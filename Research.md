# Introduction

In the rapidly evolving digital era, the rhythm-action game industry has emerged as one of the most popular genres, blending musical elements with players' physical interactions. Games like Beat Saber and Ragnarock require players to synchronize movements with musical rhythms, particularly Electronic Dance Music (EDM), offering an immersive experience through sensory synchronization. However, manual level creation in these games, including the determination of block directions and timings, demands significant time and expertise, limiting content variety and adaptation to diverse music (Summerville et al., 2020). This approach often results in static levels that lack dynamism and full alignment with the complexities of EDM rhythms, thereby reducing replayability potential and personalization of the gaming experience.

The primary challenge in rhythm-action games lies in achieving accurate rhythm synchronization between player actions and musical beats, especially in VR contexts where device latency and beat tracking accuracy are crucial. Research indicates that poor synchronization can disrupt immersion and diminish player motivation due to inaccuracies between visual-auditory inputs and motor responses (Bayd et al., 2025). For instance, in VR games like Beat Saber, players must adjust movements to fast-paced EDM tempos, but manual methods fail to measure real-time dynamics such as beat divisions and variable tempos, which impact rhythmic skills and overall performance (Yamauchi et al., 2025). This underscores the need for automation to generate adaptive and responsive levels aligned with musical structures.

To address these limitations, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), has emerged as an innovative solution in procedural content generation (PCG) for rhythm games. RL enables AI agents to learn autonomously through trial-and-error, producing dynamic level patterns based on rewards like beat synchronization (Gisslén et al., 2021). In the EDM context, this approach can analyze rhythmic features such as spectral flux and chroma to create blocks aligned with beats, reducing reliance on human designers and enhancing production efficiency (Akao, 2025). Recent studies highlight how RL improves agent generalization in complex game environments, opening opportunities for more immersive and personalized levels (Özkan, 2025).

One standout RL algorithm is Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), designed for training stability and sample efficiency, making it ideal for automating rhythm-action game levels. PPO employs a clipped objective function to prevent overly large policy updates, allowing agents to adapt to EDM rhythm variations without performance loss (Mariselvam, 2025). Research demonstrates that PPO excels in generating playable procedural content, such as in puzzle and rhythm games, where agents learn to determine timings and directions based on rhythmic feedback (Liu et al., 2021). For example, PPO implementations in Unity ML-Agents have proven to improve synchronization by 20-30% compared to traditional methods, particularly for music with dynamic tempos (Summerville et al., 2020).

Nevertheless, challenges persist in integrating PPO with beat tracking for VR rhythm games, where players' neural entrainment to EDM rhythms affects synchronization accuracy. Neurological research suggests that the human brain naturally synchronizes with musical beats, but AI must replicate these patterns to avoid desynchronization (Nozaradan et al., 2025). These issues can be addressed by combining PPO with adversarial training to enhance adaptation to tempo variations, as seen in level generation for Ragnarock, where agents produce automatic beat maps supporting full-body tracking (Giordano et al., 2023). This approach not only reduces production time by up to 50% but also boosts accessibility for indie developers seeking to upload prototypes to GitHub for open-source collaboration.

This research proposes the implementation of a PPO agent for automating block direction and timing determination in EDM-based rhythm-action games, with a focus on evaluation using cumulative rewards to measure synchronization and stability. Leveraging audio datasets from 2020-2025, the approach aims to generate more adaptive levels aligned with musical rhythms, ready for integration into GitHub repositories for community testing. The expected outcomes will contribute to more inclusive AI-driven PCG development, supporting the evolution of the rhythm game genre in the VR era (Bayd et al., 2025).

# Research Methodology

This research will adopt a quantitative approach with an experimental method to implement and evaluate the performance of a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in automating level creation for EDM-based rhythm-action games. The experimental design will encompass a series of stages, from audio data preparation and game environment development to PPO agent training, testing, and result evaluation. This approach is selected to systematically measure PPO's effectiveness in generating block timings and directions aligned with musical rhythms, as well as its ability to adapt to variations in musical complexity (Halina & Guzdia, 2020). The primary focus is to ensure that every musical component enhances and supports the overall gaming experience through automation.

The initial stage of the research involves collecting audio data focused on the EDM genre from the period 2020 to 2025. This data will be selected based on specific criteria such as audio quality, tempo variation, and rhythmic complexity to ensure comprehensive representation of EDM music. Following collection, the audio data will undergo feature extraction using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectral flux, and chroma features. This feature extraction is crucial for transforming audio signals into numerical representations understandable by the PPO agent, enabling accurate beat detection and rhythmic structure identification (Akao, 2025).

Next, the game environment will be developed using a game engine platform such as Unity, integrated with a Reinforcement Learning toolkit like ML-Agents. This environment will replicate the basic mechanics of rhythm-action games, where the PPO agent is tasked with placing blocks with precise directions and timings along the music track. The reward system will be designed to encourage the agent to achieve optimal synchronization between block placements and musical beats, with penalties for placement errors. The design of this game environment is critical for providing a realistic and interactive training ground for the PPO agent (Özkan, 2025).

The development of the PPO agent model will form the core of the implementation stage. The PPO agent will be configured with an appropriate neural network architecture to handle inputs from the extracted audio features and produce outputs in the form of block placement decisions. PPO parameters, such as learning rate, clip ratio, and gamma, will be set and adjusted through preliminary experiments to optimize performance. The PPO agent training process will be conducted iteratively, with the agent learning through interactions with the game environment and optimizing its policy based on the received cumulative rewards (Mariselvam, 2025).

The agent model evaluation will utilize quantitative metrics to measure synchronization accuracy (e.g., time offset between beats and blocks), block density, and the playability of generated levels. Several EDM songs not used in training will serve as a testing dataset to assess the PPO agent's generalization capabilities. The agent model testing will also involve subjective evaluations by human players to assess gameplay experience and the flow quality of automatically created levels, ensuring that the levels are not only technically accurate but also enjoyable to play (Bayd et al., 2025).

The research outcomes are expected to demonstrate significant improvements in the efficiency and quality of rhythm-action game level creation, with outputs in the form of a PPO model capable of generating beatmaps automatically and dynamically. All source code, datasets, and experimental results will be uploaded to a GitHub repository to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration within the AI and game development research community. This will support other developers in testing and extending the proposed approach, fostering further innovation in procedural content generation for rhythm games (Giordano et al., 2023).
